# Project 29 - Exploding Monkeys

Days 94-96 of 100 Days Of Swift

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

## Topics

Day 94: SKTexture and filling a path, and mixing UIKit and SpriteKit: UISlider and SKView.

Day 95: Texture atlases, how to simplify collision detection, how to transition between scenes.

## Challenges

Day 96:

1. Add code and UI to track the player scores across levels, then make the game end after one player has won three times.
2. Add Auto Layout rules for the UI components in our storyboard, allowing them to remain positioned neatly regardless of which iPad size is used.
3. Use the physics worldâ€™s gravity to add random wind to each level, making sure to add a label telling players the direction and strength.
